# AWS NoSQL Database Performance Testing Lab

In many financial firms, online transaction processing (OLTP) often relies on static or infrequently updated data, commonly referred to as reference data. These reference data sources do not always require ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transaction capabilities. Instead, they require support for fast read queries based on simple data access patterns and an event-driven architecture to ensure that the target systems remain up-to-date. NoSQL databases emerge as ideal candidates to meet these requirements, and cloud platforms such as AWS offer managed and highly resilient data ecosystems.

## Introduction

This article does not aim to determine which AWS NoSQL database is superior, as the concept of a "better" database is highly context-dependent. Instead, we will share a coding lab that allows you to measure the performance of AWS-managed NoSQL databases such as DynamoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and MongoDB.

### Performance Testing

We will start by defining a performance test case that concurrently inserts a JSON payload 200 times and then reads it 200 times.

#### JSON Payload

The base/parent class in `base_db.py` implements the test case logic by executing 10 concurrent threads to create and read 200 records. These threads execute the write/read routines in the `create_records` and `read_records` functions, respectively. Notably, these functions do not include any database-specific logic but instead measure the performance of each read-and-write execution.

```python
# Code snippet from base_db.py
# ...

# Create records in the database
def create_records(self, thread_id):
    for i in range(1, self.num_records + 1):
        key = int(thread_id * 100 + i)
        start_time = time.time()
        self.create_record(key)
        end_time = time.time()
        execution_time = end_time - start_time
        self.performance_data[key] = {'Create Time': execution_time}

# Read records from the database
def read_records(self, thread_id):
    for key in self.performance_data.keys():
        start_time = time.time()
        self.read_record(key)
        end_time = time.time()
        execution_time = end_time - start_time
        self.performance_data[key]['Read Time'] = execution_time
```

Once the test case is executed, the `print_stats` function prints execution metrics, including the mean and standard deviation (stdev) values, which indicate database read/write performance and consistency (a smaller stdev implies more consistent execution performance).

```python
# Code snippet from base_db.py
# ...

# Print execution statistics
def print_stats(self):
    if len(self.performance_data) > 0:
        # Create a Pandas DataFrame from performance data
        df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(self.performance_data, orient='index')
        if not df.empty:
            df.sort_index(inplace=True)
            # Calculate mean and standard deviation for each column
            create_mean = statistics.mean(df['Create Time'])
            read_mean = statistics.mean(df['Read Time'])
            create_stdev = statistics.stdev(df['Create Time'])
            read_stdev = statistics.stdev(df['Read Time'])

            print("Performance Data:")
            print(df)
            print(f"Create Time mean: {create_mean}, stdev: {create_stdev}")
            print(f"Read Time mean: {read_mean}, stdev: {read_stdev}")
```

### NoSQL Code

Unlike relational databases that support standard SQL, each NoSQL database has its own SDK. The child test case classes for each NoSQL database only need to implement a constructor and `create_record`/`read_record` functions that contain proprietary database SDK code to instantiate a database connection and create/read records in just a few lines of code.

#### DynamoDB Test Case

```python
# Code snippet from dynamo_db.py
# ...

import boto3
from base_db import BaseDB

class DynamoDB (BaseDB):

    def __init__(self, file_name='instrument.json', threads=10, records=20):
        super().__init__(file_name, threads, records)

        dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name='us-east-1')
        table_name = 'Instruments'
        self.table = dynamodb.Table(table_name)

    def create_record(self, key):
        item = {
            'key': key,
            'data': self.json_data
        }
        self.table.put_item(Item=item)

    def read_record(self, key):
        self.table.get_item(Key={'key': key})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    DynamoDB().execute()
```

### AWS Setup

To execute these performance test cases in an AWS account, follow these steps:

1. Create an EC2 IAM role with privileges to access the required AWS data services.
2. Launch an EC2 instance and assign the newly created IAM role.
3. Create each NoSQL database instance.

#### IAM Role

#### DynamoDB Table

#### Cassandra Keyspace/Table

Please note that the DB host and credentials were hardcoded and removed in the `mongo_db.py` and `redis_db.py` modules. You will need to update these with the corresponding database connection settings for your AWS account. To connect to DynamoDB and Cassandra, we opted to use the boto3 session credentials temporarily assigned to the `db_performance_iam_role` IAM role. This code will run in any AWS account in the `us-east-1` region without any modification.

```python
# Code snippet from cassandra_db.py
# ...

class CassandraDB(BaseDB):

    def __init__(self, file_name='instrument.json', threads=10, records=20):

        super().__init__(file_name=file_name, threads=threads, records=records)

        # Cassandra Keyspaces configuration
        contact_points = ['cassandra.us-east-1.amazonaws.com']
        keyspace_name = 'db_performance'

        ssl_context = SSLContext(PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
        ssl_context.load_verify_locations('sf-class2-root.crt')
        ssl_context.verify_mode = CERT_REQUIRED

        boto_session = boto3.Session(region_name="us-east-1")
        auth_provider = SigV4AuthProvider(session=boto_session)

        cluster = Cluster(contact_points, ssl_context=ssl_context, auth_provider=auth_provider, port=9142)
        self.session = cluster.connect(keyspace=keyspace_name)
```

#### EC2 Script

Connect to the EC2 instance (we used the Session Manager) and run the following shell script to perform these tasks:

1. Install Git.
2. Install Python3.
3. Clone the GitHub `db_performance` repository.
4. Install and activate the Python3 virtual environment.
5. Install third-party libraries/dependencies.
6. Execute each test case.

```shell
sudo yum install git
sudo yum install python3

git clone https://github.com/dshilman/db_performance.git
sudo git pull

cd db_performance
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate

sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

cd code
sudo python3 -m dynamo_db
sudo python3 -m cassandra_db
sudo python3 -m redis_db
sudo python3 -m mongo_db
```

You should see the following output for the first two test cases:

```shell
(venv) sh-5.2$
